# Workbench - the VSCode Extension

Group favorite files into a workbench!

The purpose of this extension is to be a small helper that collects all your favorite files 
together (into a workbench) and provides an easy navigation between them. 

This is a beta version. Please read the roadmap and raise an issue if you see how this extension can be 
made better!

## Usage

Mark a file as favorite from the Command Palette or editorâ€™s Title Menu.

To rename an alias of a favorite file:

* Open the config file (command: `Workbench: Open Config`)
* Edit the alias manually
* Reload the config file (command: `Workbench: Reload Config`)

## Features

  * Parent directory name used as prefix (can be disabled through configuration `foxWorkbench.prefixAliasWithDirName`)
* Listing files from a workbench (i.e. browsing favorites)
  * Command: `Workbench: List Files`
  * Shortcut: `Alt+Q` (works in the editor and on explorer)

  * Command: `Workbench: Open All Files`
* Removing an opened file from the workbench (command: `Workbench: Remove Current File`)
* Removing chosen file from the workbench (command: `Workbench: Remove Chosen File`)

## Development Notes

* Promises are handled with `await` operator

## Roadmap

* External editions of storage file (`workbench.json`) should trigger a reload of in-memory data
* Editing file aliases 
* [Epic] Switch between multiple workbenches 

## Known Issues

* *Editing an alias requires triggering a config reload* File aliases can be renamed to anything by 
editing the `workbench.json` file and invoking `Workbench: Reload Config`. 
There are features on the roadmap to enable automatic reloads and allow alias editing from a command.
